# Codeloufinalproject
Code Louisville Final Project.

This Project is about my GrandFather who's a well known religious leader that has over 100 millions followers world wide.

The site consists of three pages, the Home page, Photo Gallery, and his Life History.

The Home page is about his biography, quote, poem and some of the followers nationalities.

The Photo gallery page consists of some of his pictures.

The life history talks about detailed history of his life.

I used chrome as my default browser and also run it in IE and Microsoft edge.
